- utilize ViewModels and display templates instead of changing the domain model OR use a separate branch to make changes to the domain model.

### What will we continue doing

- continue to use the same communication methods IE: Discord, Jira, Github, etc.

### Nehemiah's Notes

Nehemiah wanted to add the following but we didn't have enough time to get the teams response.

what would you start doing?

- Start advocating for a better structure for our meetings, that addresses every single point which needs addressing, so that we are not scrambling last minute. 
- During each meeting, one person should be taking notes (we can rotate takin notes for each meeting or we can just make the scrum master take notes), which will get pinned in the Team 3 chat, so that we can come back, and see what we discussed instead of having to scroll up in chat to see messages/things discussed.

keep doing?

- Continue our communication via discord chat.
- Making a meeting plan road map (SCRUM master has been doing this.)

Stop doing?

- Making big decisions in chat. Like what we are doing right now. This assignment should have been addressed during our meeting time in VC. And I am not pointing fingers at anyone, I am holding myself accountable to this just as much as the other teammates.
