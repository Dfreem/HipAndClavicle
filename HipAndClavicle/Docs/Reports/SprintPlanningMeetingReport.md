# Hip - and - Clavicle : Sprint1

**Sprint Date**: 04/3 - 04/16

**Meeting Date**: 4/15

**Participants Present**:

- Michael
- Nehemiah
- Steven
- Devin

**SCRUM mast**: Devin Freeman

**Client Review Date**: Scheduled for 4/13 @ 4pm

**Blocking Issues to Resolve**:

- Devin had a mix up in the beggining, so he did the admin orders page when he intended to do the admin products page. He was able to also get most of the way through the Products page as well, but both views remain very bare and need further attention.
- Nehemiah's PR needs some revising before being merged into main. 1 or 2 PR's have been merged into main since then, so he will need to update his branch with main before he can merge his PR.
- Some of the Jira issues have gotten a little confusing. This is currently being remedied and many stories have been split into subissues, however many remain to be split up.
