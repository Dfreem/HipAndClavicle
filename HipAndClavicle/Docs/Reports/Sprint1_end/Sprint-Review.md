Overall, the client was very happy with our progress so far. She really liked the order tracking feature and the shop by color feature. She was a bit thrown off by the rough nature of the site so far, but we explained to her that this is a pre-alpha version and that a lot of the features and especially styling have not been implemented yet. She also gave us a lot of good feedback on features she's hoping to see next, and those were added to the next sprint.
