# Sprint 2 Start

Good morning everyone! We are starting our second sprint today. Additionally, we completed out first sprint review yesterday and I realized, I didn't have a chance to weigh in with any additions to the questions in the report.

following I am recapping what has been suggessted so far and adding my own thoughts. As you may recall, the team was unable to finalize these proposed changes, so my suggesstion is that we finish discussing changes today, Mon 4/17 at the work session that we are changing to 2pm per the discussion that took place during this impromptu meeting.

The three questions the report guide asked are:

- What will we stop doing?
- What will we start doing?
- What will we continue doing?

## Steven

Steven offered the first set of suggestions

**What will we stop doing**

- no more weekend or night meetings
  - included in this, the team should take a look at the current meeting schedule and re-schedule future meetings.

**What will we start doing**

- Meetings and work time go back to normal class time @2:00pm
***(Nehemiah said this would work with his new schedule)***

## Nehemiah

Nehemiah's contribution is as follows.

**what would you start doing?**

- Start advocating for a better structure for our meetings, that addresses every single point which needs addressing, so that we are not scrambling last minute. 
- During each meeting, one person should be taking notes, which will get pinned in the Team 3 chat, so that we can come back, and see what we discussed instead of having to
- scroll up in chat to see messages/things discussed.

**keep doing?**

- Continue our communication via discord chat.
- Making a meeting plan road map

**Stop doing?**

- Making big decisions in chat.

## Devin

The following are my suggestions for the team. Following that, I have included the same questions, answered from a personal scope.

### What will we stop doing

- **Having one person managing jira board planning.**
The team is modeled on a self organizing agile team, which means that we will manage our own issues and assignments as they are complete.

- **One person managing domain model changes.**
Brian has provided us with a method of integrating common project changes via an un-owned branch.

- **Maintaining documentation in 3 places**.
I was personally attempting to maintain three locations for all our documentation to increase availability, however it has resulted in more time spent for me and no less confusion for the team. All documentation should be included in the projects Docs directory. This directory will have a semi-permanent branch.

### What will we start doing

- **utilize ViewModels and display templates**
Instead of changing the domain model OR use a separate branch to make changes to the domain model. This will limit the risk of merge conflicts.

- **Re-evaluate story points and sub-issues before starting a user story**

### What will we continue doing

- continue to use the same communication methods IE: Discord, Jira, Github, etc.
- 4 Daily standups a week (different time)
- 4 work sessions a week (different time)

### Personal

As a set of personal guidelines, I will be implementing the following changes for myself.

#### What will I stop doing

- **Answering tutor questions outside of tutor hours**

  I would like to limit the amount of time I spend personally answering C#, ASP, or academic type questions. I am still going to maintain the same willingness to offer input on team matters, however if you would like help learning something that may have been covered in this or a previous class, I ask that you make an appointment with me during the time I have allotted. During work sessions, it may be appropriate to ask about specific implementationswithin our project.I reserve the right to make the decision to handle the question during tutor hours instead.
  &emsp;<small><b>(note: these sessions are completely free of charge)</b></small>
<br />

- **Updating All design documentation**
  So far I have taken upon myself to maintain any updates done to the design documentation, mostly because I have had time to get to it first. I do not regret this, the level of understanding I have been able to achieve from this has pulled me a long way. I'm worried however, that the rest of the team has not been able to achieve the same level of working knowledge of the project. It has also resulted in quite a lot of working hours from me not spent towards user stories. Therefore I would like to suggest that we all record our own changes to the design in the documentation.

#### What will I start doing

- **Start Focusing on user stories**
  I am currently satisfied with the level of preperation I have done for the project as our first SCRUM master and would like to commit now to turning my focus on completing the user stories I take on. I know the rest of you will be great SCRUM masters, and I look forward to continue efforts towards project completion.

- **Record specific start and stop times**
  I have been trying to record the time I have spent working on the project in jira, but I often forget the exact amount of time something took me. I would like to start recording when I start and stop working on something, instead of attempting to remember it later
