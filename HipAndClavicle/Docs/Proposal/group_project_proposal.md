# Group A Proposal - MooDo Tae-kwon-do

## What does the organization do?

> **MooDo Taekwondo & Hapkido** is a community of friends and martial artists in Eugene, Oregon. Our training reflects our intention to live strong and positive lives and to help each other to do the same. In this spirit, we challenge each other and ourselves to work toward personal excellence without being combative in our practice. Achieving a strong, flexible, and healthy body is the beginning of the important journey of gaining mastery of your life. Mental strength is the reward for training the body. Strong body and mind give confidence and higher expectations in life. The benefits of training in the martial arts goes much deeper than self-defense and fighting.
MooDo Taekwondo hosts the popular Oregon State Hanmadang, an All Styles, Martial Art Skills Tournament & EXPO.

## Current Needs of the Business

### Reqruiting and Student Registration

Currently, the site does not have a way to register a new student for classes. This is an essential need for a business with an online presence for a few reasons.

- As a way to easily bridge the gap between prospective students that happen to stumble on the website, and someone actively looking for a Taekwondo class.
- In order to reduce any friction for a prospective student might have while looking for a Taekwondo school to join.
- To allow prospective students to compare services of MooDo to other options in the area. Sometimes just the presence of well defined price plans will be the deciding factor as to whether a student's continues their search, or decides to sign up with MooDo.
- Automating the registration and payment for classes will free the owners up to attend to more important or less frequent matters.

### Integrated Business Management Solution

The organizations current website is built with Wordpress. This leads our team to believe that if the site is re-built, it is necessary to have a tool or portal for the owner of the business to easily update and change aspects of the website. This will also allow the owner to quickly access information needed for running his business such as sales metrics, class registratioin etc.

### Clearly Defined Goals, Services, and Motivations

The aparent theme / organization of the site appears to be uncoordinated and unstructured. For instance the main highlight on the front page, is an informative article about the air filtering system that is being used. It is unclear if this is an endorsment, an affiliate of the business or what the connection to the business.
The article attached to the advertisement does mention that MooDo invested in it during the pandemic to ensure the safety and health of their students. It is currently taking up a sizable portion of the Home page. This realestate should be used to highlight the business, but perhaps in a more ecenomical and focused manor.
We determine a need for grouping logically related information together for instance instructor highlights, may make sense to be grouped with the class schedule as it is currently, but not the facebook news feed that is located on the side of the page, or the photo and video section should be one section.

### Public Access to Online Presence

The business has started an online Yoga and Breathing session that they stream Tuesday & Thursdays vie FB Live. This feature is buried into the rest of the classes in the schedule, however could be a very good engagement tool for building a community and customer base. We are determining there to be a need here for better community outreach and connection, as this is a common support tool for this type of business. The business model surrounds teaching and connecting to the public, and to do so in an increasingly online public, this is one essential area to show a strong presence.

## Software Solution Proposal

Our proposal to meet the needs that we have identified of this business are as follows:

### Reqruiting Students and Registration

To meet the need of reqruiting and registering new studentsthe following features will provide support.

- A Database of upcoming events.
- A Database of students.
- An Online class registration Form.
- An online Student Registration Form.
- A link to third party payment system (may be out of scope => stub/moq).
- A form for a prospective student to easily register for class, or a one week free trial (this is already offered but not easy to access.)
- Active or disabled buttons to register for classes.
  - The Button is active if there are spots left in the class.
  - Button is disabled if the class is full.

### Business and Site Management Solution

To meet the need for an integrated solution for viewing, updating and managing the information on the site, the following features are recomended by our team.

- an admin only area with controls to admin only options.
- a media upload/delete dialog.
- a Database of instructors.
- a Database of media (Photos & Videos) currently being displayed on the site.

- setup embeded link to social media.
- uploading and deleting photos.
- changing upcoming schedules.
- color scheme of the site
- link to third party payment solution to pre-pay for classes.

### Access to Online Presence

With the goal of reclaiming the Main page and using it to Highlight the business, the following features are being suggested:

- a standardized, well planned, and logical navigation system / Site Map.
- Hightlight the morning class on the front page, along with information about the instructor that hosts it and what happens during the session.
- A link to the FB Live so it is very easy to hop right into the session.
- Rotation of a class highlights banner or card featuring a constantly rotating course that would chang autmatically at a certain time interval, say 1 week.
- Currently there is a separate photos and videos page. These should be combined for increased site simplicity.
- current media features should be carried across, such as embedded video links and downloadable pictures.

### Goals, Services, and Motivation

With the goal of defining to the public what that goal and intentions of the company are, and sharing where the motivations of the owner lie, the following features will be implimented:

- an easy to find FB link to morning yoga
- A way to watch the class from the site itself.
- A comments submission area.
- Links to instructors social media accounts.
- Air filtration information (see current homepage)
- An advert for Friday Open Floor
- location and map
- Owner / Instructor Highlights page
- Collect and display highlights that are spread across the site, and concentrate them on one page.
      For instance the current news page highlights an award that the owner recently received and is very proud of. Instead of burying that at the bottom of the news page, Once it is an older story (after 1-2 weeks) this highlight can then be moved to a more permanent spot associated with the owner and instructors achievements.
